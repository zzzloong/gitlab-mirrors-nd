# Contributing

I enjoy contributions and encourage them!  You should add your code to my
project and make your mark.  [Pick off an issue][issues] or implement a feature
filling your need.  I only make a few simple requests in order to contribute.

* Test your own work before submitting a pull request.  Most of this project is
  bash code so we do not have the luxury of a test driven framework to assist
  our development.  Needless to say I will be sure to test it myself before it
  ever makes it into a production release.
* Create a feature branch with a name that does not exist in any of my branches
  (e.g. `feature/myfeature` or `feature-cool_feature`).  This is where you
  should do your development.  This will allow you to integrate my development
  with your own and ease integrating updated code if we're both concurrently
  developing.
* When your feature is ready make a pull request to the *development* branch.
  Pull requests to the master branch will not be accepted.  The master branch is
  intended to drive production systems and only stable production-ready commits
  will be made to it.

Happy hacking!
